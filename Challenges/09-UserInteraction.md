# Azure Cloud Workshops - Serverless Architecture - Challenge 09 - User Interaction

In this challenge, you will complete the work by creating a .Net MVC Web application that will interact with the Service Bus to allow users to review and approve the license plates (updating the plate as necessary).  Additionally, time permitting, a reporting page can be built to review data in from the legacy system.
